This was my project in [Mario Solis-Garcia's](https://sites.google.com/a/macalester.edu/solis-garcia/) Macroeconomic Modeling class (Econ 472) in Spring 2024.

For the project, I was interested in how representative agent assumptions affect DSGE models. I created a New Keynesian model and analyzed how the economy responded to shocks to government spending, total factor productivity, and the interest rate. Mirroring other research in the topic, I found that the addition of individual heterogeneity to the model increased the volatility of the economy and enlarged the shorter-term effects of the shock.

More generally, this project acted as a precursor to [my honors project in economics](https://gavinengelstad.github.io/projects/hank_and_inequality/) where I work with a HANK model. During the project, I implemented Rendahl's Linear Time Iteration to solve the model, which guided my interest in using computational modeling to analyze real world phenomena.
