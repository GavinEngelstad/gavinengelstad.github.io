### Description:

Starting in summer 2024, I worked with [Gaurav Khanna](https://www.econgaurav.com), [Harrison Mitchell](https://harrisonwmitchell.github.io), and Aakash Bhalothia to estimate and understand city wage premiums.

We use an AKM and movers design estimate to analyze how place affects earnings. Unlike past similar work, we use a panel from LinkedIn with more than 500 million people from around the world, which allows us to take a more global perspective and analyze both country and city effects.

The current version of the paper is linked below and is availible on NBER. In January 2026, I'll be presenting the work at the STEG annual conference.
