### Description:

Starting in summer 2024, I worked with [Gaurav Khanna](https://www.econgaurav.com) and two grad students to examine city wage premiums.

We use an AKM and movers design estimate to analyze how place affects earnings. Unlike past similar work, we use a global panel from LinkedIn with more than 500 million people, which allows us to take a more global perspective and analyze both country and city effects.

A very early draft of the paper is linked below. It will be periodically updated as I have more recent versions.
