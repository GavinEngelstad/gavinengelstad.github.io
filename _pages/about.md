Hi! I'm a senior math/economics student at Macalester College in Saint Paul, MN.

I'm interested in topics at the intersection of computational mathematics and economics. In particular, I'm interested in using computational modeling and econometric tools to better understand macroeconomics, inequality, and business cycles.

Previously, I've worked on research under [Lori Ziegelmeier](https://www.loriziegelmeier.com) and [Russell Funk](https://www.russellfunk.org) using topological data analysis to analyze how scientific knowledge grows and evolves within fields. I've also worked under [Gaurav Khanna](https://www.econgaurav.com) to understand how where people are located geographically affects how much they earn using a dataset that spans the whole world.

Currently, I'm working on expanding on both of the above projects. I'm also doing an honors project in economics analyzing household differences in responses to business cycles using a heterogeneous agent New Keynesian (HANK) model.
