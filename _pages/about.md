Hi! I'm a first year economics PhD student at Northwestern University.

I'm interested in using microdata in computational models to emprially test macroeconomic hypothesis and better understand how micro-events can have macro-consequences.

In my undergraduate educaiton at Macalester College, I majored in both economics and mathematics (with an honors thesis in both) and minored in computer science.

Previously, I've worked on research under [Lori Ziegelmeier](https://www.loriziegelmeier.com) and [Russell Funk](https://www.russellfunk.org) using topological data analysis to analyze how scientific knowledge grows and evolves within fields. I've also worked under [Gaurav Khanna](https://www.econgaurav.com) to understand how where people are located geographically affects how much they earn using a dataset that spans the whole world.

Currently, I'm working on expanding on both of the above projects. I'm also doing an honors project in economics analyzing household differences in responses to business cycles using a heterogeneous agent New Keynesian (HANK) model.
