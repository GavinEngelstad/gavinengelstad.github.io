Hi! I'm a senior math/economics student at Macalester College in Saint Paul, MN.

My interests lie in the use of computational mathematical tools to model human phenomena. I'm passionate about how we can use these tools to better understand people's interactions and behavior.

Previously, I've worked on research under [Lori Ziegelmeier](https://www.loriziegelmeier.com) and [Russel Funk](https://www.russellfunk.org) using Topological Data Analysis to analyze how scientific knowledge grows and evolves within a field. I've also worked under [Gaurav Khanna](https://www.econgaurav.com) on the effect where people are located geographically has on how much they can earn using a dataset that spans the whole world.

Currently, I'm working on expanding on both of the above projects. I'm also doing a project analyzing the transmission channels of inequality using a Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) model.
